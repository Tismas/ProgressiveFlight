# Progressive Flight


## Mod adds blocks that give creative flight in a radius around the block

### Blocks and items
- wooden tier - 4 blocks
- copper tier - 16 blocks
- iron tier - 64 blocks
- diamond tier - dimension in which block is placed
- netherite - cross dimension

### Configuration
It's configurable to:

- require power or not
- scale power requirements (by default it takes 4/16/64/1024/4096 RF/tick)
- allow or disallow placement of the blocks in other dimensions (so that flight in the end or nether requires you to build netherite tier item)
